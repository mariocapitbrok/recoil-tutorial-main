# Setup

1. Install dependencies by running `npm install`. Skip this step if doing the tutorial on the web.

2. For Recoil to work, the components that use recoil state need `RecoilRoot` to appear somewhere in the parent tree. A good place to put this is in your root component inside `/src/index.js`:

<highlight block="true" file="/src/index.js" lines="[11,13]" selected="true">

Wrap the `<App />` component with `<RecoilRoot>`:

```js
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RecoilRoot>
      <App />
    </RecoilRoot>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```
</highlight>

3. Run your app by doing `npm start`. You should see the app running on `localhost:3000` (or whatever port it chooses). Ignore the warnings and errors as throughout the tutorial we will be implementing the missing pieces. Skip this step if doing the tutorial on the web.
